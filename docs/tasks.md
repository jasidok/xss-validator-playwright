# XSS Validator Improvement Tasks

This document contains a checklist of improvement tasks for the XSS Validator project. Each task is designed to enhance the functionality, reliability, or usability of the tool.

## Core Functionality Improvements

[x] Enhance payload detection by implementing JavaScript execution verification instead of just checking for payload reflection
[x] Add support for all Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
[x] Implement a more robust form submission mechanism that can handle different types of forms
[x] Add support for authentication to test protected pages
[x] Create a mechanism to detect DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities
[x] Implement a reporting system that generates detailed HTML or JSON reports

## Payload Management

[x] Create a default set of XSS payloads in JSON format
[x] Implement a payload categorization system (e.g., by attack type, browser target)
[x] Add payload effectiveness scoring based on success rate
[x] Create a payload generator for custom contexts

## Configuration and Usability

[x] Implement a configuration file system for persistent settings
[x] Create a command-line interface with options for different testing scenarios
[x] Add progress indicators and verbose logging options
[x] Implement a simple web UI for easier configuration and result visualization
[x] Add support for crawling websites to automatically discover testable inputs

## Testing and Reliability

[x] Create a comprehensive test suite for the tool itself
[x] Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests
[x] Add timeout configuration options
[x] Create a known-vulnerable test application for demonstration and testing
[x] Implement session handling for maintaining state between requests

## Performance Improvements

[x] Implement parallel testing across multiple pages or inputs
[x] Add caching mechanisms to avoid redundant tests
[x] Optimize browser resource usage
[x] Implement smart payload selection to reduce test time

## Documentation and Examples

[x] Create detailed API documentation
[x] Add more example scripts for common testing scenarios
[x] Create a troubleshooting guide
[x] Document integration with CI/CD pipelines
