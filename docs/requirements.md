# XSS Validator Requirements

## Project Goals
- Provide an automated tool for detecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications
- Support testing of various XSS attack vectors
- Generate clear reports of detected vulnerabilities
- Be easily extensible with new payloads and detection methods

## Functional Requirements
1. The tool must be able to test web applications for XSS vulnerabilities
2. The tool must support multiple browsers via Playwright
3. The tool must be able to inject XSS payloads into form fields
4. The tool must detect if payloads are successfully executed
5. The tool must support custom payloads
6. The tool must provide detailed reporting of findings

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance: The tool should be able to test a typical web page in under 5 minutes
2. Usability: The tool should be easy to use with minimal configuration
3. Extensibility: The tool should be designed to allow easy addition of new payloads and detection methods
4. Reliability: The tool should produce consistent results across multiple runs

## Constraints
1. The tool must use Playwright for browser automation
2. The tool must be compatible with Node.js version 14 and above
3. The tool must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems
