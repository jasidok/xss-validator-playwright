# Intruder Integration Upgrade Plan

## Overview

Implement a modernized version of the PhantomJS XSS Validator's "extension-generated" payload functionality with
enhanced context awareness, intelligent payload generation, and higher detection accuracy.

## Core Burp Extension Enhancements

### Payload Generator Implementation

[x] Implement `IIntruderPayloadGeneratorFactory` interface in ModernXSSValidator.py

[x] Register extension as payload generator with Burp Suite
[x] Add "XSS Validator" option to Intruder's "Payload type" dropdown
[x] Implement payload position tracking for context-aware generation

### Context Analysis Engine

[x] Implement HTML context detection (inside tags, attributes, scripts, etc.)
[x] Add attribute context analysis (single quoted, double quoted, unquoted, event handlers)
[x] Implement JavaScript context detection (string literals, code blocks, function calls)
[x] Add URL context detection (path, query parameters, fragments)
[x] Implement CSS context detection (style attributes, inline styles)
[x] Add comment context detection (HTML, JS, CSS comments)
[x] Implement encoding detection (URL encoded, HTML entities, Unicode, mixed)
